## Core Config
The core config is maintained at https://github.com/Mulan-Szechuan-Sauce/nvim-config by friends of mine for easier sharing. I wanted to make a few updates so I made a fork here which I use https://github.com/Faiz-C/nvim-config.git.
Check out the original creators though!

## Usage
Clone the repo mentioned above into ~/.config/nvim (.config/nvim in your home directory) and then link (or copy) .user.nvim under your home directory. Then open neovim on your terminal and watch Lazy work!
Note: run `:checkhealth` after everything loads for the first time. You might need to install some binaries to get the full functionality out of the neovim plugins. Using the output of the health check you can
see what you might be missing.
